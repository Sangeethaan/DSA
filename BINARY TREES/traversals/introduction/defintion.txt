Basic Terms

Root
The topmost node of the tree. It has no parent.

Child
A node directly connected below another node (its parent).

Leaf (Leaf Node)
A node that has no children.

Subtree
A tree formed by any node and all of its descendants.

Ancestors
All nodes on the path from a node up to the root (excluding the node itself).

Types of Binary Trees

Full Binary Tree
Every node has either 0 or 2 children (no node has only one child).

Complete Binary Tree
All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, and the last level is filled from left to right.

Perfect Binary Tree
All internal nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

Balanced Binary Tree
The height difference between the left and right subtree of every node is at most 1.

Degenerate Binary Tree
Each parent node has only one child, making the tree look like a linked list.
